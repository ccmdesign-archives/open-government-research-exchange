Virtually all sectors, from development to healthcare to education to politics, have been transformed.

Figuring out how to evolve the Internet’s governance in ways that are effective and legitimate is essential to ensure its continued potential. Flexible and innovative decision-making mechanisms are needed in order to enable disparate governance actors to address and respond effectively as changes in the network occur. This paper seeks to address the need to develop an effective and legitimate Internet governance ecosystem by proposing a distributed yet coordinated framework that can accommodate a plurality of existing and emerging decision-making approaches. It draws on the lessons of open governance, adopting innovative techniques to facilitate coordination, information sharing, and evidence generation by and across increasingly diverse and global groups of Internet actors, and calls for creating practical tools to support such an effective, legitimate and evolving Internet governance ecosystem. Although no right answer or single model for how to manage all issues of relevance to the Internet is suggested within this paper, the proposed framework intends to allow for diverse experiments in distributed governance approaches to learn what works and what does not."},{"id":"a87ff679a2f3e71d9181a67b7542122c","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Reimagining Governance in Practice: Benchmarking British Columbia’s Citizen Engagement Efforts","organization":"the-govlab","authors":["Andrew Young","Christina Rogawski","Sabeel Rahman","Stefaan Verhulst"],"paper_date":"5/1/2013","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2560761","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Open Data"],"objective":["Access","Effectiveness","Legitimacy","Participation"],"methodology":["Comparative Analysis","Survey"]},"sector":false,"region":"north-america","type":"research-report","github":"","abstract":"Over the last few years, the Government of British Columbia (Canada) has initiated a variety of practices and policies aimed at providing more legitimate and effective governance.

Second, the ‘who’ question: what is the profile of the typical expatriate i-voter? Finally, the turnout question: did the extension of internet voting to the expatriates have an effect on electoral mobilization? Our findings indicate that the online channel is very popular among expatriates, both if compared to other trials in Switzerland itself and internationally. On the other hand, known patterns regarding the profile of i-voters and the effect on mobilization seem to be also replicated in the expatriate trials. Expatriate i-voters tend to be young, male, and there is some evidence of an upper-class bias. Thus, usage of the online channel seems driven by the digital divide also among expatriates. Moreover, we find some evidence that i-voting did not affect electoral mobilization, similarly to trials involving residents."},{"id":"c20ad4d76fe97759aa27a0c99bff6710","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Police.uk and Data.police.uk: Developing Open Crime and Justice Data for the UK","organization":false,"authors":["Amanda M Smith","Tom Heath"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://www.jedem.org/index.php/jedem/article/view/326","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Case Analysis"]},"sector":"public-safety","region":"europe","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"In this paper we describe the evolution and development of the police.uk and data.police.uk sites, which publish open data about crime and justice in the UK, and make it accessible and comprehensible to the public.

In order to empower the role of citizen in this context, we propose an approach that relies on the establishment of a physical and intellectual space for shared understanding and collaboration between all stakeholders impacted by an environmental problem (in our case odour emission). Based on the development of an Information Technology (IT) system allowing odour emission measurement as well as the collection of citizen feedback, a Living Lab (LL) approach is being implemented that involves citizens, public authorities, industry and environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs). According to the definition of the European commission, Living Labs are “open innovation environments in real-life settings, in which userdriven innovation is fully integrated within the co-creation process of new services, products and societal infrastructures”. Based on this definition and considering, in our case, citizens as one of the end-users of the IT system, we argue that such an approach will empower their role in local environmental governance. This article presents the method and techniques that will be used in order to set up such a Living Lab. More precisely, we focus here on the first step of this method: defining the components that will support the management of a Living Lab relying on an IT system. This step consists in the identification of the Living Lab stakeholders (citizen, industry, public authorities, NGOs, etc.), including their characteristics, fears, expectations, involvement and engagement regarding the Living Lab. To do this, 2 main approaches are being combined: A Living Lab approach that aims to involve citizens in local Environmental Governance (LEG) design. Use of Human-Centred Design (HCD), to combine IT developments and LL needs, for example Personas methodology and usability test. A Living Lab relies mainly on stakeholders’ involvement in order to build trust and establish a common goal. In this sense, sociologists’ approaches ((Akrich et al. 2006);) bring valuable information on how to mobilise different actors in order to innovate (Actor Network Theory). However, in the innovation process, these approaches are only considering human actors and do not take into account any technological aspects. However, if Living Labs are relying on human actors’ interactions it should also take into account their interactions with the IT system it is based on. In this case, HumanCentred Design (HCD) being an approach that aims to make IT systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, is to be considered as complementary to the sociologists approaches. This article, based on the work performed in the FP7 European project OMNISCIENTIS, presents the theoretical context in which this study takes place as well as the overall methodology."},{"id":"9bf31c7ff062936a96d3c8bd1f8f2ff3","related_content":[{"url":"https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/bostons-office-of-new-urban-mechanics-innovation-for-the-public-good/","title":"Boston’s Office of New Urban Mechanics: Innovation for the Public Good"}],"access":"","title":"Citizen-Centered Government: The Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics and the Evolution of CRM in Boston","organization":false,"authors":["Susan P.

In particular, the City of Boston's strategy to put citizen engagement and participation at the center of its efforts, implemented by Chris Osgood and Nigel Jacob as co-chairs of the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, has drawn attention to the potential power of collaboration and technology to transform citizens' connections to their government and to each other. Several global developments have combined to make Boston's collaborative efforts interesting: First, city managers around the world confront shrinking budgets and diminishing trust in the role of government; second, civic entrepreneurs and technology innovators are pressuring local governments to adopt new forms of engagement with citizens; and third, new digital tools are emerging that can help make city services both more visible and more effective. Boston's experience in pursuing partnerships that facilitate opportunities for engaging citizens may provide scalable (and disruptive) lessons for other cities.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, in anticipation of Mayor Menino's retirement in January 2014, Prof. Susan Crawford and Project Assistant Dana Walters carried out a case study examining the ongoing evolution of the Boston Mayor's Hotline into a platform for civic engagement. We chose this CRM focus because the initial development of the system provides a concrete example of how leaders in government can connect to local partners and citizens. In the course of this research, we interviewed 21 city employees and several of their partners outside government, and gathered data about the use of the system. (Exhibit A is a list of interviewees.)\n\nWe found a traditional technology story — selection and integration of CRM software, initial performance management using that software, development of ancillary channels of communication, initial patterns of adoption and use — that reflects the commitment of Mayor Menino to personalized constituent service. We also found that that commitment, his long tenure, and the particular personalities of the people on the New Urban Mechanics team make this both a cultural story as well as a technology story. Here are the highlights: The combination of Mitchell Weiss's vision for citizen engagement, Nigel Jacob's expertise in software development and digital strategy, Chris Osgood's experience in navigating government bureaucracy, and Bill Oates's (CIO) private-sector experience has allowed this team to launch successful projects and build valuable partnerships that focus on citizen-centered innovation; Even without budgetary authority or staff, the innovation office within the Mayor's suite (the Office of New Urban Mechanics) has been able to nudge, encourage, and facilitate collaborations inside City Hall and across academic institutions, technologists, and other city governments that have been productive; As one example of the team's joint efforts and partnerships, both inside and outside City Hall, the launch of Boston's Lagan CRM system in October 2008 was followed by integration of the system into the operations of several constituent-facing service departments; The system has evolved over time to include, among other things, a mobile app for field workers in the Department of Public Works (City Worker), a smartphone app for citizens (Citizen Connect), reports that are useful for performance management, and several different channels through which citizens can interact with City Hall, while retaining its high-touch, personalized character; Although every CRM system case is assigned a case ID number, the CRM system as a whole does not automatically assign a unique identifier to citizens that would allow uniform tracking across different modes of contact (smartphone app, Web interface, phone call) or mapping of particular citizens to particular neighborhoods. Constituents who contact the system may voluntarily provide contact details (name, home address, email, and phone); Future versions of this system, and layering of CRM data over other City data (911, inspections, sensor data, social sentiment data, traffic data), could make possible much more extensive citizen collaboration, situation awareness, policy inputs, performance analysis, and co-creation of government services or policies. Although there are many channels for reporting into the CRM system — Citizens Connect, SMS, web chat, phone calls — all of the people reporting in are not connected to each other, and the lack of unique identifiers makes true \"citizen relationship management\" difficult. Customer satisfaction is also not measured by the system, as far as we can tell. Outbound calls, texting, and Twitter/social media sentiment mining might be useful tools for this assessment; Combining formal CRM requests with social sentiment information could provide useful guidance underpinning policy decisions and resource allocation. Connecting all of this information to job functions within City Hall would also clearly be productive. And if we believe that people in their communities know more about their communities than all the gifted people in City Hall, how do we enable them to help themselves solve some of their own problems? Boston City Hall has not been focused on predictive analytics or the public release of data; rather, the team's top priorities (in line with Mayor Menino's strategy) have been to improve service delivery and encourage citizen engagement; Mayor Menino's leadership style, strategic goals, and long tenure, together with the particular personalities of the members of the core team profiled in this study, have been essential to this narrative; The longterm effects on either the operation of City government or citizen engagement of the Office of New Urban Mechanics and the innovative, experimental ethos encouraged by that Office, Chief of Staff Mitchell Weiss, and CIO Bill Oates are unclear. Much will depend on the character and priorities of the new mayor.\n\n"},{"id":"c74d97b01eae257e44aa9d5bade97baf","related_content":[{"url":"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/537161/data-fusion-heralds-city-attractiveness-ranking/","title":"Data Fusion Heralds City Attractiveness Ranking"}],"access":"","title":"Scaling of City Attractiveness for Foreign Visitors Through Big Data of Human Economic and Social Media Activity","organization":false,"authors":["Stanislav Sobolevsky","Iva Bojic","Alexander Belyi","Izabela Sitko","Bartosz Hawelka","Juan Murillo Arias","Carlo Ratti"],"paper_date":"4/22/2015","url":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06003v1.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":"economy","region":"europe","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Scientific studies investigating laws and regularities of human behavior are nowadays increasingly relying on the wealth of widely available digital information produced by human social activity.

We explored the use of Facebook likes as potential predictors of health outcomes and their behavioral determinants.\n\nMethods: We performed principal components and regression analyses to examine the predictive qualities of Facebook likes with regard to mortality, diseases, and lifestyle behaviors in 214 counties across the United States and 61 of 67 counties in Florida. These results were compared with those obtainable from a demographic model. Health data were obtained from both the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and mortality data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System.\nResults: Facebook likes added significant value in predicting most examined health outcomes and behaviors even when controlling for age, race, and socioeconomic status, with model fit improvements (adjusted R2) of an average of 58% across models for 13 different health-related metrics over basic sociodemographic models. Small area data were not available in sufficient abundance to test the accuracy of the model in estimating health conditions in less populated markets, but initial analysis using data from Florida showed a strong model fit for obesity data (adjusted R2=.77).\n\nConclusions: Facebook likes provide estimates for examined health outcomes and health behaviors that are comparable to those obtained from the BRFSS.

They were also asked to provide information about themselves as part of the audience that uses legislation online. The overall aim of the project was to develop empirical insights into characteristics of law that may make it easy or hard to read for the audience that use it. Also, the project aimed to assess machine learning for automatically predicting readability of legal sentences at sentence level. A major focus of this paper is to report results and insights from demographic data collected during the study. Understanding the audience which reads the law is directly relevant to readability - as the relevant question is readable by whom? Who are the citizens for whom “citizen access” might be enhanced? The paper also describes methods used to rank sentences by readability, using the data provided by citizen scientists. Finally, the paper reports initial tests on the viability of machine learning as a means of predicting readability in advance. The exploratory machine learning results reported here will be extended in further work reported in a future paper. The research provides insight into who uses legal rules and how they do so. We draw conclusions as to the current readability of law, as well as the spread of readability among legal rules.

The increase in scale of new crises, the urbanisation of many displaced populations, and stretched financing for humanitarian assistance are forcing international aid agencies to think and act in new ways. Along with other international humanitarian actors, several United Nations (UN) bodies are engaging with new tools and practices to bring innovation to the forefront of their work. Within these agencies, there has been a growing movement to establish ‘innovation spaces’ or ‘innovation labs’. These labs take different forms – some virtual, others physical – and each is created with its own motivations unique to the context in which it operates. Despite the variation, there is a growing trend in the UN system, and more broadly in the international humanitarian community, to create labs as a way to engage in and facilitate innovation practice. This research seeks to understand the way in which innovation labs across several UN agencies are being used to foster new ways of operating within the UN’s bureaucratic structures. We ask four key questions: What form do innovation labs in UN agencies take? What motivated their initiation? What are their aims and objectives?

This article contributes to this research agenda by examining the developments in attitudes among the users on the Finnish website Avoin Ministeriö (“Open Ministry”) which orchestrates crowdsourcing of legislation by providing online tools for deliberating ideas for citizens' initiatives.

In fact, under the Obama administration, a policy of using the “whole community” approach to emergency planning has been adopted. This approach, however, creates an obvious problem for state and local government practitioners already under pressure for funding, time, and the continuous need for higher and broader expertise—the problem of how to actually incorporate the whole community into emergency planning efforts.

The public sector consists of a complex open system of organizations with various tasks. Therefore, decision-making can be slower than in the private sector because of large chains of command. Innovations here will often have an impact across this complex organizational structure, and thus must be supported by a robust strategy. To strengthen democracy, promote government efficiency and effectiveness, discourage wastes and misuses of government resources, public administrations have to promote a new stronger level of openness in government. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe an innovative approach for the governance of public systems and services, currently applied in the Italian public administration domain, which could be easily replicated in other countries as well. Two initiatives, to collect and provide relevant public information gathered from different and heterogeneous public organizations, to improve government processes and increase quality of services for citizens and companies, are described. The cases adopted have been validated through a case analysis approach involving the Italian Agency for the public administration digitalization to understand new e-government scenarios within the context of governmental reforms heavily influenced by the principles of Open Government Model."},{"id":"19ca14e7ea6328a42e0eb13d585e4c22","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"‘Data.gov-in-a-box’: Delimiting transparency","organization":false,"authors":["Clare Birchall"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://est.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/02/27/1368431014555259.abstract","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Legitimacy","Participation"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":"economy","region":"north-america","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Given that the Obama administration still relies on many strategies we would think of as sitting on the side of secrecy, it seems that the only lasting transparency legacy of the Obama administration will be data-driven or e-transparency as exemplified by the web interface ‘data.gov’.

The purpose of this tool is to be used by city planners as part of a strategic approach to the implementation of a smart city initiative in order to reduce unnecessary public spending and ensure the optimal allocation of city resources.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– The information and communication technologies that manage and transform twenty-first century cities must be reviewed, analyzing their impact on new social behaviors that shape the spaces and means of communication, developing a new methodology and setting the basis for an analysis matrix to score the different and technologies that affect a smart city environment.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n– Traditional technological scenarios have been challenged, and smart cities have become the center of urban competitiveness. A lack of clarity has been detected in the way of describing what smart cities are, and the authors try to establish a methodology for urban policy makers to do so.

One problem with manipulation, thus understood, is that it fails to respect people’s autonomy and is an affront to their dignity. Another problem is that if they are products of manipulation, people’s choices might fail to promote their own welfare, and might instead promote the welfare of the manipulator. To that extent, the central objection to manipulation is rooted in a version of Mill’s Harm Principle: People know what is in their best interests and should have a (manipulation-free) opportunity to make that decision. On welfarist grounds, the norm against manipulation can be seen as a kind of heuristic, one that generally works well, but that can also lead to serious errors, at least when the manipulator is both informed and genuinely interested in the welfare of the chooser. \n\nFor the legal system, a pervasive puzzle is why manipulation is rarely policed. The simplest answer is that manipulation has so many shades, and in a social order that values free markets and is committed to freedom of expression, it is exceptionally difficult to regulate manipulation as such. But as the manipulator’s motives become more self-interested or venal, and as efforts to bypass people’s deliberative capacities becomes more successful, the ethical objections to manipulation become very forceful, and the argument for a legal response is fortified. The analysis of manipulation bears on emerging first amendment issues raised by compelled speech, especially in the context of graphic health warnings. Importantly, it can also help orient the regulation of financial products, where manipulation of consumer choices is an evident but rarely explicit concern."},{"id":"d67d8ab4f4c10bf22aa353e27879133c","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Competition-Based Innovation: The Case of the X Prize Foundation","organization":false,"authors":["Mokter  Hossain","Ilkka  Kauranen"],"paper_date":"10/20/2014","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2549616","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Case Analysis"]},"sector":false,"region":"north-america","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"The use of competition-based processes for the development of innovations is increasing.

But, according to Tapscott and Williams, “when it comes to innovation, competitive advantage and organizational success, ‘openness’ is rarely the first word one would use to describe companies and other societal organizations like government agencies or medical institutions. For many, words like ‘insular,’ ‘bureaucratic,’ ‘hierarchical,’ ‘secretive’ and ‘closed’ come to mind instead.”1 And yet a few months ago, The Tesla Model S just became the world's first open-source car. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motor Vehicles, shared all the patents on Tesla's electric car technology, allowing anyone — including competitors — to use them without fear of litigation. Elon wrote in his post “Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.”2\nIn the public sector, terms such as open government, citizen sourcing, and wiki government are also akin to the notion of open innovation and transparency. As Hilgers and Ihl report, “a good example of this approach is the success of the Future Melbourne program, a Wiki and blog-based approach to shaping the future urban landscape of Australia’s second largest city. The program allowed citizens to directly edit and comment on the plans for the future development of the city. It attracted more than 30,000 individuals, who submitted hundreds of comments and suggestions (futuremelbourne.com.au). Basically, problems concerning design and creativity, future strategy and local culture, and even questions of management and service innovation can be broadcasted on such web-platforms.”3 The authors suggest that there are three dimensions to applying the concept of open innovation to the public sector: citizen ideation and innovation (tapping knowledge and creativity), collaborative administration (user generated new tasks and processes), and collaborative democracy (improve public participation in the policy process)."},{"id":"a1d0c6e83f027327d8461063f4ac58a6","related_content":[{"url":"http://www.fiercecities.com/story/what-cities-can-learn-new-york-and-chicagos-311-systems/2015-01-27","title":"What cities can learn from New York and Chicago's 311 systems"}],"access":"","title":"Can 311 Call Centers Improve Service Delivery?

Open data and open government initiatives promise to “open up” government operations to citizens. New forms of “big data” analysis can be used by government itself to understand citizens' behavior and reveal the strengths and weaknesses of policy and service delivery. In practice, however, open data emerges as a reform development directed to a range of goals, including the stimulation of economic development, and not strictly transparency or public service improvement. Meanwhile, governments have been slow to capitalize on the potential of big data, while the largest data they do collect remain “closed” and under-exploited within the confines of intelligence agencies. Drawing on interviews with civil servants and researchers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States between 2011 and 2014, this article argues that a big data approach could offer the greatest potential as a vehicle for improving mutual government–citizen understanding, thus embodying the core tenets of Digital Era Governance, argued by some authors to be the most viable public management model for the digital age (Dunleavy, Margetts, Bastow, & Tinkler, 2005, 2006; Margetts & Dunleavy, 2013)."},{"id":"d9d4f495e875a2e075a1a4a6e1b9770f","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Open Government and Democracy: A Research Review","organization":false,"authors":["Karin Hansson","Kheira Belkacem","Love Ekenberg"],"paper_date":"","url":"http://ssc.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/12/03/0894439314560847.abstract","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Open Data"],"objective":["Legitimacy","Participation"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"The concept of open government, having been promoted widely in the past 5 years, has promised a broader notion than e-government, as supposed to fundamentally transform governments to become more open and participative and collaborative.

In this paper, we have therefore constructed a framework for the analysis of open government from a democratic perspective, to explore the research foundation of open government and the types of research missing. We have looked closely at the notion of democracy in peer-reviewed journals on open government from 2009 to 2013, focusing on discussions of some fundamental issues regarding democracy and the type of solutions suggested. We have found that despite seemingly good intentions and an extensive rhetoric, there is still an apparent lack of adequate tools in which public deliberation and representation are addressed in any meaningful sense. There are two main important observations herein: (i) the rhetoric in the dominant discourse supports the concept of open government formulated by the Obama administration as transparency, participation, and collaboration, but in practice, the focus is predominantly on transparency and information exchange, while ignoring fundamental democratic issues regarding participation and collaboration, and (ii) the concept of the public is inadequately considered as a homogenous entity rather than a diversified group with different interests, preferences, and abilities."},{"id":"67c6a1e7ce56d3d6fa748ab6d9af3fd7","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Opening Government: Designing Open Innovation Processes to Collaborate With External Problem Solvers","organization":false,"authors":["Ines Mergel"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://ssc.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/12/11/0894439314560851","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Expert Networking"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":false,"region":"north-america","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Open government initiatives in the U.S. government focus on three main aspects: transparency, participation, and collaboration.

In practice, government organizations recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government agencies are responding to these requirements by using open innovation (OI) approaches to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S. government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to create innovative public management ideas. This article systematically reviews existing government crowdsourcing and peer production initiatives and shows that after agencies have defined their public management problem, they go through four different phases of the OI process: (1) idea generation through crowdsourcing, (2) incubation of submitted ideas with peer voting and collaborative improvements of favorite solutions, (3) validation with a proof of concept of implementation possibilities, and (4) reveal of the selected solution and the (internal) implementation of the winning idea.

With the popularity of social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In this study, tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the website Twitter were collected and analyzed for their potential as surveillance for seasonal influenza.\nObjective: There were three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city through filtering and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to observe correlations of tweets for emergency department ILI rates by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego.\nMethods: Tweets containing the keyword “flu” were collected within a 17-mile radius from 11 US cities selected for population and availability of ILI data. At the end of the collection period, 159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses with sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as reported by the corresponding city or county health department. Two separate methods were used to observe correlations between tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by type (non-retweets, retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the use of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet was “valid”, or from a user who was likely ill with the flu.\nResults: Correlations varied by city but general trends were observed. Non-retweets and tweets without a URL had higher and more significant (P<.05) correlations than retweets and tweets with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department ILI rates were higher than the correlations observed for sentinel-provided ILI for most of the cities. The machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations for many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency department ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. High correlation values (r=.93) with significance at P<.001 were observed for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and tweets determined to be valid by the classifier.\nConclusions: Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a supplementary surveillance tool for influenza as better filtering and classification methods yielded higher correlations for the 2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in the previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates were better correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI rates. Further investigations in the field would require expansion with regard to the location that the tweets are collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.\n\n"},{"id":"2838023a778dfaecdc212708f721b788","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"A New Taxonomy of Smart City Projects","organization":false,"authors":["Guido Perbolia","Alberto De Marcoc","Francesca Perfettia","Matteo Marone"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146514001914","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Data Analysis"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"City logistics proposes an integrated vision of freight transportation systems within urban area and it aims at the optimization of them as a whole in terms of efficiency, security, safety, viability and environmental sustainability.

Our work is a timely illustration of computational approaches to law as the legal profession embraces technology for scholarship, to increase efficiency, and to improve access to justice."},{"id":"d82c8d1619ad8176d665453cfb2e55f0","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Crowd-Sourcing Corruption: What Petrified Forests, Street Music, Bath Towels and the Taxman Can Tell Us About the Prospects for Its Future","organization":false,"authors":["Dieter Zinnbauer"],"paper_date":"9/15/2014","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2508606","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"conference-article","github":"","abstract":"This article seeks to map out the prospects of crowd-sourcing technologies in the area of corruption-reporting. A flurry of initiative and concomitant media hype in this area has led to exuberant hopes that the end of impunity is not such a distant possibility any more - at least not for the most blatant, ubiquitous and visible forms of administrative corruption, such as bribes and extortion payments that on average almost a quarter of citizens reported to face year in, year out in their daily lives in so many countries around the world (Transparency International 2013). \n\nOnly with hindsight will we be able to tell, if these hopes were justified. However, a closer look at an interdisciplinary body of literature on corruption and social mobilisation can help shed some interesting light on these questions and offer a fresh perspective on the potential of social media based crowd-sourcing for better governance and less corruption. So far the potential of crowd-sourcing is mainly approached from a technology-centred perspective. Where challenges are identified, pondered, and worked upon they are primarily technical and managerial in nature, ranging from issues of privacy protection and fighting off hacker attacks to challenges of data management, information validation or fundraising. \n\nIn contrast, short shrift is being paid to insights from a substantive, multi-disciplinary and growing body of literature on how corruption works, how it can be fought and more generally how observed logics of collective action and social mobilisation interact with technological affordances and condition the success of these efforts. \n\nThis imbalanced debate is not really surprising as it seems to follow the trajectory of the hype-and-bust cycle that we have seen in the public debate for a variety of other technology applications. From electronic health cards to smart government, to intelligent transport systems, all these and many other highly ambitious initiatives start with technology-centric visions of transformational impact. However, over time - with some hard lessons learnt and large sums spent - they all arrive at a more pragmatic and nuanced view on how social and economic forces shape the implementation of such technologies and require a more shrewd design approach, in order to make it more likely that potential actually translates into impact.\n\nAt a minimum, a trawl through this literature makes it possible to move beyond some of the most common-sense conjectures and develop a few more granular guesses on the future of crowd-sourcing corruption. At best, this approach may help identify some not so obvious challenges that may arise along the way and ensure that they are considered in the design process of future corruption crowd-sourcing interventions, raising their likelihood of impact and sustainable success.\n\nThe remainder of this essay is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the concept of crowd-sourcing for good governance. It provides a very brief overview of some related initiatives in this area, alongside some of the challenges and reservations that are commonly raised in the debate. Section 2 casts the net a bit wider. It looks for interesting insight and cues in the broader social science literature on social mobilisation and corruption. Based on this, it seeks to gain a better understanding of what other more fundamental challenges may lay ahead for crowd-reporting corruption. Section 3 picks up on these anticipated challenges and presents some ideas on how to address them, both in the design, as well as in the implementation of future crowd-reporting systems, drawing both on emerging insights from impact assessments of conventional social accountability mechanisms as well as lessons learnt within Transparency International’s own global network of anti-corruption NGOs, some of which already run crowd-reporting platforms.\n\n"},{"id":"a684eceee76fc522773286a895bc8436","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"“Open” disclosure of innovations, incentives and follow-on reuse: Theory on processes of cumulative innovation and a field experiment in computational biology","organization":false,"authors":["Kevin J.

To that end, we conducted an extensive review of the crowdsourcing landscape, including a look at what types of taxonomies are currently available. Our review found that no taxonomy explored the multidimensional nature of task complexity. This paper develops a taxonomy whose specific intent is the classification of approaches in terms of the types of tasks for which they are best suited. To develop this task-based taxonomy, we followed an iterative approach that considered over 100 well-known examples of crowdsourcing. The taxonomy considers three dimensions of task complexity: (a) task structure – is the task well-defined, or does it require a more open-ended solution; (2) task interdependence – can the task be solved by an individual, or does it require a community of problem solvers; and (3) task commitment – what level of commitment is expected from crowd members? Based on this taxonomy, we identify seven categories of crowdsourcing and discuss prototypical examples of each approach. Furnished with such an understanding, one should be able to determine which crowdsourcing approach is most suitable for a particular task situation."},{"id":"66f041e16a60928b05a7e228a89c3799","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Behavioral Political Economy: A Survey","organization":false,"authors":["Jan Schnellenbach","Christian Schubert"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_4988.html","taxonomy":{"category":["Behavioral Science and Nudges"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Explaining individual behavior in politics should rely on the same motivational assumptions as explaining behavior in the market: That’s what Political Economy, understood as the application of economics to the study of political processes, is all about.

However, most of the open data sets rely on selection criteria, based on a technology-driven perspective, rather than a focus on the potential public and social value of data to be published. Several experiences and reports confirm this issue, such as those of the Open Data Census. However, there are also relevant best practices. The goal of this paper is to investigate the different dimensions of a framework suitable to support public administrations, as well as constituencies, in assessing and benchmarking the social value of open data initiatives. The framework is tested on three initiatives, referring to three different countries, Italy, the United Kingdom and Tunisia. The countries have been selected to provide a focus on European and Mediterranean countries, considering also the difference in legal frameworks (civic law vs. common law countries)."},{"id":"32bb90e8976aab5298d5da10fe66f21d","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Big Data: Google Searches Predict Unemployment in Finland","organization":false,"authors":["Joonas Tuhkuri"],"paper_date":"8/14/2014","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/rif/report/31.html","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":"economy","region":"europe","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"There are over 3 billion searches globally on Google every day.

Predicting the present and the near future is of interest, as the official records of the state of the economy are published with a delay. To assess the information contained in Google search queries, the report compares a simple predictive model of unemployment to a model that contains a variable, Google Index, formed from Google data. In addition, cross-correlation analysis and Granger-causality tests are performed. Compared to a simple benchmark, Google search queries improve the prediction of the present by 10 % measured by mean absolute error. Moreover, predictions using search terms perform 39 % better over the benchmark for near future unemployment 3 months ahead. Google search queries also tend to improve the prediction accuracy around turning points. The results suggest that Google searches contain useful information of the present and the near future unemployment rate in Finland."},{"id":"d2ddea18f00665ce8623e36bd4e3c7c5","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Beyond just politics: A systematic literature review of online participation","organization":false,"authors":["Christoph Lutz","Christian Pieter Hoffmann","and Miriam Meckel"],"paper_date":"7/7/2014","url":"http://www.firstmonday.dk/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5260/4094","taxonomy":{"category":["Civic Technology"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Comparative Analysis"]},"sector":false,"region":"europe","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"This paper presents a systematic literature review of the current state–of–research on online participation.

Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made in recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common and regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis (JE). On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner without learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they would get alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the known disease season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the disease impact (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning in the next season. However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable deaths and sickness, and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific progress could have enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing countries like India.\n\n \n\nIn this paper, we show that if public agencies provide historical disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with statistical and machine learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices in disease control, and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to provide timely guidance for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using open data for mosquito-borne communicable diseases; published results in public health on efficacy of Dengue control methods and apply it on a simulated typical city for maximal benefits with available resources. The exercise helps us further suggest strategies for new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data could be better recorded by city agencies and what prevention methods should medical community focus on for wider impact."},{"id":"fbd7939d674997cdb4692d34de8633c4","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Brief survey of crowdsourcing for data mining","organization":false,"authors":["Guo Xintong","Wang Hongzhi","Yangqiu Song","and Gao Hong"],"paper_date":"12/1/2014","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417414003984","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Comparative Analysis"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Crowdsourcing allows large-scale and flexible invocation of human input for data gathering and analysis, which introduces a new paradigm of data mining process.

Less is known about the effectiveness of these sites as a method for collecting data for health research and the means to use such powerful tools in health research.\nObjective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the available literature and explore the use of SNS as a mode of collecting data for health research. The review aims to answer four questions: Does health research employ SNS as method for collecting data? Is data quality affected by the mode of data collection? What types of participants were reached by SNS? What are the strengths and limitations of SNS?\nMethods: The literature was reviewed systematically in March 2013 by searching the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, using the Ovid and PubMed interface from 1996 to the third week of March 2013. The search results were examined by 2 reviewers, and exclusion, inclusion, and quality assessment were carried out based on a pre-set protocol.\nResults: The inclusion criteria were met by 10 studies and results were analyzed descriptively to answer the review questions. There were four main results. (1) SNS have been used as a data collection tool by health researchers; all but 1 of the included studies were cross-sectional and quantitative. (2) Data quality indicators that were reported include response rate, cost, timeliness, missing data/completion rate, and validity. However, comparison was carried out only for response rate and cost as it was unclear how other reported indicators were measured. (3) The most targeted population were females and younger people. (4) All studies stated that SNS is an effective recruitment method but that it may introduce a sampling bias.\nConclusions: SNS has a role in health research, but we need to ascertain how to use it effectively without affecting the quality of research. The field of SNS is growing rapidly, and it is necessary to take advantage of the strengths of this tool and to avoid its limitations by effective research design. This review provides an important insight for scholars who plan to conduct research using SNS."},{"id":"35f4a8d465e6e1edc05f3d8ab658c551","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Crowdsourcing Parking Lot Occupancy using a Mobile Phone Application","organization":false,"authors":["Erfan Davami","and Gita Sukthankar"],"paper_date":"6/16/2014","url":"http://www.ase360.org/handle/123456789/107","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Civic Technology"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Analysis","Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":"transportation","region":"north-america","type":"conference-article","github":"","abstract":"• Participatory sensing is a specialized form of crowdsourcing for mobile devices in which the users act as sensors to report on local environmental conditions. • This poster describes the process of prototyping a mobile phone crowdsourcing app for monitoring parking availability on a large university campus. • We present a case study of how an agent-based urban model can be used to perform a sensitivity analysis of the comparative susceptibility of different data fusion paradigms to potentially troublesome user behaviors: 1.

Despite of its increasing availability, its level of adoption has not been satisfying. On the other hand, over the last years, coinciding with the web 2.0 trend, the e-government services co-produced by citizens start to appear, often without the support, acknowledgement and even awareness of the government. This trend stems from a well-established tradition of offline co- production of public services, i.e. services provided by the voluntary sector, but brought to an unprecedented scale thanks to the advent of web 2.0. Still, the concept remains not well-defined and its impact is not yet well studied. The paper explores on a limited sets of cases what does it mean to collaboratively deliver online public services; what are the success factors based on the cases under study and what are the incentives for service providers (other than public administration), citizens as users and public administration. The authors propose an ostensive definition of the collaborative delivery of public services: collaborative public services are created and run by government, civil society or by private sector building on the re-use of government data or citizens data. Those services are focused on public goods delivery (e.g. health, education, public transport) and are meant to change the traditional government services by engaging in an open dialogue with public administration about the best way to deliver those services. The analysis of six case studies of innovative collaborative online public services suggests that the online collaborative public service delivery increases its quality with the users׳ growth contrary to the traditional offline service delivery. The study results indicate that the current developers interest lies in delivering complementary services to the government run services rather than substitutive services. The authors propose also the initial list of success factors, enabling conditions, and benefits for all main stakeholders (users, innovators and public administration)."},{"id":"68d30a9594728bc39aa24be94b319d21","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Conceptualizing Open Data ecosystems: A timeline analysis of Open Data development in the UK","organization":false,"authors":["Maximilian Heimstädt","Fredric Saunderson","Tom Heath"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://hdl.handle.net/10419/96627","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Access","Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Quantitative Analysis","Survey"]},"sector":false,"region":"europe","type":"working-paper","github":"","abstract":"In this paper, we conceptualize Open Data ecosystems by analysing the major stakeholders in the UK.

We developed and piloted the mobile application DocCHIRP, which uses a system of point-to-multipoint push notifications designed to help providers problem solve by crowdsourcing from their peers.

Indeed, three kinds of operations are conducted that progressively instantiate open data. The first one is exploration.

This paper provides a perspective of digital change efforts across the UK government as an illustration of the improvements taking place more broadly in the public sector. It provides a vision for the future of our digital world, revealing the symbiotic relationship between organisational change and digitisation, and offering insights into public service delivery in the digital economy"},{"id":"98dce83da57b0395e163467c9dae521b","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"True Collective Intelligence?

At the center of crowdsourcing is a resource allocation problem: there is an abundance of workers but a scarcity of high skills, and an easy task assigned to a high-skill worker is a waste of resources. This problem is complicated by the fact that the exact difficulties of innovation tasks may not be known in advance, so tasks that require high-skill labor cannot be identified and allocated ahead of time. We show that the solution to this problem takes the form of a skill hierarchy, where tasks are first attempted by low-skill labor, and high skill workers only engage with a task if less skilled workers are unable to finish it. This hierarchy can be constructed and implemented in a decentralized manner even though neither the difficulties of the tasks nor the skills of the candidate workers are known. We provide a dynamic pricing mechanism that achieves this implementation by inducing workers to self-select into different layers.

Indeed, they not only strive to span organisational, sectoral and geographical boundaries by bringing a variety of uncommon actors together to embrace radical ideas and out-of-the box thinking, but they also aim to apply the concept of openness throughout the innovation process, including the experimentation and development phases. While the phenomenon of labs clearly forms part of a broader trend towards openness, it seems to transcend traditional conceptualisations of open innovation (Chesbrough, 2006), open strategy (Whittington et al., 2011), open science (David, 1998) or open government (Janssen et al., 2012). What are innovation labs about, how do they differ from other innovation efforts and how do they embrace openness to create breakthrough innovations? This short exploratory paper is an introduction to a larger empirical study aiming to answer these questions."},{"id":"2b44928ae11fb9384c4cf38708677c48","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Medical Wikis Dedicated to Clinical Practice: A Systematic Review","organization":false,"authors":["Alexandre Brulet","Guy Llorca","Laurent Letrilliart"],"paper_date":"2/1/2015","url":"http://www.jmir.org/2015/2/e48/","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Comparative Analysis"]},"sector":"healthcare","region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Background: Wikis may give clinician communities the opportunity to build knowledge relevant to their practice. The only previous study reviewing a set of health-related wikis, without specification of purpose or audience, globally showed a poor reliability.\nObjective: Our aim was to review medical wiki websites dedicated to clinical practices.\nMethods: We used Google in ten languages, PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, and Web of Science to identify websites. The review included wiki sites, accessible and operating, having a topic relevant for clinical medicine, targeting physicians or medical students. Wikis were described according to their purposes, platform, management, information framework, contributions, content, and activity. Purposes were classified as “encyclopedic” or “non-encyclopedic”. The information framework quality was assessed based on the Health On the Net (HONcode) principles for collaborative websites, with additional criteria related to users’ transparency and editorial policy. From a sample of five articles per wikis, we assessed the readability using the Flesch test and compared articles according to the wikis’ main purpose. Annual editorial activities were estimated using the Google engine.\nResults: Among 25 wikis included, 11 aimed at building an encyclopedia, five a textbook, three lessons, two oncology protocols, one a single article, and three at reporting clinical cases. Sixteen wikis were specialized with specific themes or disciplines. Fifteen wikis were using MediaWiki software as-is, three were hosted by online wiki farms, and seven were purpose-built. Except for one MediaWiki-based site, only purpose-built platforms managed detailed user disclosures. The owners were ten organizations, six individuals, four private companies, two universities, two scientific societies, and one unknown. Among 21 open communities, 10 required users’ credentials to give editing rights. The median information framework quality score was 6 out of 16 (range 0-15). Beyond this score, only one wiki had standardized peer-reviews. Physicians contributed to 22 wikis, medical learners to nine, and lay persons to four. Among 116 sampled articles, those from encyclopedic wikis had more videos, pictures, and external resources, whereas others had more posology details and better readability. The median creation year was 2007 (1997-2011), the median number of content pages was 620.5 (3-98,039), the median of revisions per article was 17.7 (3.6-180.5) and 0.015 of talk pages per article (0-0.42). Five wikis were particularly active, whereas six were declining. Two wikis have been discontinued after the completion of the study.\nConclusions: The 25 medical wikis we studied present various limitations in their format, management, and collaborative features. Professional medical wikis may be improved by using clinical cases, developing more detailed transparency and editorial policies, and involving postgraduate and continuing medical education learners."},{"id":"c45147dee729311ef5b5c3003946c48f","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Online Consultation and Governance Reform in Chinese Ministries and Provinces","organization":false,"authors":["Steven J.

The analysis demonstrates that online consultation practices are more developed in provincial governments than central government ministries. Across organizational contexts, online consultation is more advanced in the disclosure of proposed policies than in the circulation of feedback submitted in response to draft laws and regulations. Finally, online consultation is primarily utilized by organizations with substantial resources, as well as organizations operating in environments not characterized by fundamental political sensitivities. These results are consistent with the expectation that although online consultation increases information disclosure and public participation in government decision making, such reforms are indicative not of the end of authoritarianism but rather the resilience of the Chinese Communist Party."},{"id":"eb160de1de89d9058fcb0b968dbbbd68","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Participatory Budgeting in the Dominican Republic: Implications for Agency, Democracy and Development","organization":false,"authors":["Vasquez Duran","Marie Claire"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/16141?utm_content=buffer95007&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis","Survey"]},"sector":false,"region":"north-america","type":"thesisdissertation","github":"","abstract":"This study examines participatory budgeting (PB) as an important kind of citizen participation in the Dominican Republic (DR) and the implications of this recent practice for agency, democracy, and development. PB is a process that intends to drive change with specific outcomes: through deliberative decision-making, ordinary citizens select well-being- and agency-enhancing projects that ideally lead to more local and authentic development. Together with the attainment of these tangible outcomes, valuable subjective states may also come about: people feel more in charge of their own lives, community groups become more collaborative and cooperative, and more and better democracy is fostered. Taking a step forward from previous studies that only focus on PB from an urban planning or public finance perspective, the overall objective of this study is to provide a deeper understanding and assessment of how PB works in the localities under analysis, its association with different measures of agency, the characteristics that drive its success or failure, and its general impact on the lives of individuals and communities. Drawing on normative and policy-based literatures and specifically following an agency-oriented capability approach, this study uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze interview, survey, and direct observations of PB public assemblies, and archival data with respect to the 2013 budget cycle in four DR municipalities. A regression analysis finds that participation in and awareness of PB are both significantly correlated with individuals reporting higher levels of individual and collective agency when compared to non-participants and unaware individuals. These measures of agency are contextualized to the municipal budget-planning cycle. A process tracing analysis concludes that PB is likely, under certain conditions, to increase democratic participation and deliberation. However, due to certain democratic deficits, PB in two DR municipalities does not always increase agency, group cooperative functioning, and good development. Thus, PB must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis because differences in the characteristics of each PB assembly may lead to different outcomes. It is finally argued that rather than condemning democracy because of the failures of the current PB system, we should advance PB's democracy further by improving it in various ways."},{"id":"5ef059938ba799aaa845e1c2e8a762bd","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Score Another One for the Internet?

Widespread use of the internet and web 2.0 technologies have made it easier for organizations to connect with their clients, service providers, and the public at large for more collaborative problem solving and innovation. Introduction of the Open Government initiative accompanied by the America Competes Reauthorization Act signaled an unprecedented commitment by the US Federal Government to stimulating more innovation and creativity in problem solving. The policy and legislation empowered agencies to open up their problem solving space beyond their regular pool of contractors in finding solutions to the nation's most complex problems.\n\nThis is an exploratory study of the adoption of challenges as an organizational innovation in public sector organizations. The main objective is to understand and explain how, and under what conditions challenges are being used by federal agencies and departments as a tool to promote innovation. The organizational innovation literature provides the main theoretical foundation for this study, but does not directly address contextual aspects regarding the type of innovation and the type of organization. The guiding framework uses concepts drawn from three literature streams: organizational innovation, open innovation, and public sector innovation.\n\nResearch was conducted using a qualitative case study of challenge.gov. Data was collected from multiple adopting agencies using two primary sources: interviews with challenge managers and administrators and, archival data from the challenge.gov web platform. Related documentation was used to supplement and corroborate the main data. Analysis of the platform archival data revealed four types of challenges falling along a continuum of increasing innovation. The sequence of events, activities and conditions leading to adoption and implementation were represented as a challenge adoption model. Variations among components of the model resulted in three distinct agency groupings represented as a typology of enactments characterized as inertia, application, and change. Thus challenge adoption among agencies with varying missions, operations and conditions leads to varying enactment types and different levels of change."},{"id":"c8ffe9a587b126f152ed3d89a146b445","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"When Talk Trumps Text:The Democratizing Effects of Deliberation during Constitution-Making, 1974-2011","organization":false,"authors":["Todd A.

But they need support from better tools to extend this critical work.\nUnlike many popular examples of collective intelligence such as open source software, people coming to patient organisations are not motivated by pre-existing technical skills, but by urgent personal needs.

Focusing on the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business."},{"id":"42a0e188f5033bc65bf8d78622277c4e","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Equality of Participation Online Versus Face to Face: Condensed Analysis of the Community Forum Deliberative Methods Demonstration","organization":false,"authors":["Eric Showers","Nathan Tindall","Todd Davies"],"paper_date":"8/4/2015","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00883","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Online deliberation may provide a more cost-effective and/or less inhibiting environment for public participation than face to face (F2F).

Similarly, behavioral scientists now have access to“big data”sets–those from Twitter and Facebook, for example–that did not exist a few years ago. Studies of human dynamics based on these data sets are novel and exciting but, if not placed in context, can foster the misconception that mass-scale online behavior is all we need to understand, for example, how humans make decisions. To overcome that misconception, we draw on the field of discrete-choice theory to create a multiscale comparative “map” that, like a principal-components representation, captures the essence of decision making along two axes: (1) an east–west dimension that represents the degree to which an agent makes a decision independently versus one that is socially influenced, and(2) a north–south dimension that represents the degree to which there is transparency in the payoffs and risks associated with the decisions agents make. We divide the map into quadrants, each of which features a signature behavioral pattern. When taken together, the map and its signatures provide an easily understood empirical framework for evaluating how modern collective behavior may be changing in the digital age, including whether behavior is becoming more individualistic, as people seek outexactly what they want, or more social, as people become more inextricably linked, even“herdlike,” in their decision making.We believe the map will lead to many new testable hypotheses concerning human behavior as well as to similar applications throughout the social sciences."},{"id":"e00da03b685a0dd18fb6a08af0923de0","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Push, Pull, and Spill: A Transdisciplinary Case Study in Municipal Open Government","organization":false,"authors":["Jan Whittington","Ryan Calo","Mike Simon","Jesse Woo","Meg Young","Peter Schmiedeskamp"],"paper_date":"7/24/2015","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2636074","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data","Smart Cities"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Analysis"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Cities hold considerable information, including details about the daily lives of residents and employees, maps of critical infrastructure, and records of the officials’ internal deliberations.

Today, we share publicly our findings on how Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are leveraging open data for a variety of purposes. Our paper “Open Data: A 21st Century Asset for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises” seeks to build a portrait of the lifecycle of open data—how it is collected, stored and used. It outlines some of the most important parameters of an open data business model for SMEs.\n\nThe universe of SMEs we analyzed comprised those identified within the GovLab’s Open Data 500 project which contains data on how 500 US businesses are using open data in their day-to-day activities. It represents arguably the first systematic effort to really understand how open data can grow revenues, drive innovation, increase efficiency and create new jobs.\n\nThe paper analyzes ten aspects of open data and establishes ten principles for its effective use by SMEs. Taken together, these offer a roadmap for any SME considering greater use or adoption of open data in its business.\n\nAmong the key findings included in the paper:\n\nSMEs, which often lack access to data or sophisticated analytical tools to process large datasets, are likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries of open data.\nGovernment data is the main category of open data being used by SMEs. A number of SMEs are also using open scientific and shared corporate data.\nOpen data is used primarily to serve the Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, followed by the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) markets. A number of the companies studied serve two or three market segments simultaneously.\nOpen data is usually a free resource, but SMEs are monetizing their open-data-driven services to build viable businesses. The most common revenue models include subscription-based services, advertising, fees for products and services, freemium models, licensing fees, lead generation and philanthropic grants.\nThe most significant challenges SMEs face in using open data include those concerning data quality and consistency, insufficient financial and human resources, and issues surrounding privacy.\nThis is just a sampling of findings and observations.

Process-based data release policy, which resembles the law of data security, will help us move past the limitations of focusing on whether data sets have been “anonymized.” It draws upon different tactics to protect the privacy of data subjects, including accurate deidentification rhetoric, contracts prohibiting reidentification and sensitive attribute disclosure, data enclaves, and query-based strategies to match required protections with the level of risk.

Some 1182 respondents age between 18 and 25 were randomly sampled from the six zones and selection of samples was based on ethnic ratio. The data was analysed descriptively and inferentially using SPSS 20.0 From the results, majority of the respondents, 89% are social media users having a social media account. A discouraging trend with regard to participation is the very low level of giving comments on general societal issues ranging from social issues, the environment to politics. The youth are more inclined to using the new media for entertainment and social networking. It is time to use the new media to engage with community leaders and politicians and comment on issues related to political issues.

Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health.\n\nObjective: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms.\n\nResults: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data."},{"id":"140f6969d5213fd0ece03148e62e461e","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Digilantism: An Analysis of Crowdsourcing and the Boston Marathon Bombings","organization":false,"authors":["Johnny Nhan","Laura Huey","Ryan Broll"],"paper_date":"12/6/15","url":"http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/06/bjc.azv118.abstract","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Analysis"]},"sector":"national-security","region":"north-america","type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"This paper explores the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing incident and how members of the general public, through the online community Reddit, attempted to provide assistance to law enforcement through conducting their own parallel investigations.

Following this we consider what if any privacy protection is currently given in UK law to SOCMINT. Given the largely negative response to the above question, we analyse what reasonable expectations of privacy there may be for users of public social media, with reference to existing case law on art 8 of the ECHR. Two factors are in particular argued to be supportive of a reasonable expectation of privacy in open public social media communications: first, the failure of many social network users to perceive the environment where they communicate as “public”; and secondly, the impact of search engines (and other automated analytics) on traditional conceptions of structured dossiers as most problematic for state surveillance. Lastly, we conclude that existing law does not provide adequate protection for open SOCMINT and that this will be increasingly significant as more and more personal data is disclosed and collected in public without well-defined expectations of privacy."},{"id":"82aa4b0af34c2313a562076992e50aa3","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"A Taxonomy of Open Government Data Research Areas and Topics","organization":false,"authors":["Yannis Charalabidis","Charalampos Alexopoulos","Euripidis Loukis"],"paper_date":"1/4/16","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10919392.2015.1124720","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"The opening of government data, in order to have both social and economic value generated from them, has attracted the attention and interest of both researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, such as information systems, management sciences, political and social sciences, and law.

A new online program, CrowdMed, aims to leverage the “wisdom of the crowd” by giving patients an opportunity to submit their cases and interact with case solvers to obtain diagnostic possibilities.\n\nObjective: To describe CrowdMed and provide an independent assessment of its impact.\n\nMethods: Patients submit their cases online to CrowdMed and case solvers sign up to help diagnose patients. Case solvers attempt to solve patients’ diagnostic dilemmas and often have an interactive online discussion with patients, including an exchange of additional diagnostic details. At the end, patients receive detailed reports containing diagnostic suggestions to discuss with their physicians and fill out surveys about their outcomes. We independently analyzed data collected from cases between May 2013 and April 2015 to determine patient and case solver characteristics and case outcomes.\n\nResults: During the study period, 397 cases were completed. These patients previously visited a median of 5 physicians, incurred a median of US $10,000 in medical expenses, spent a median of 50 hours researching their illnesses online, and had symptoms for a median of 2.6 years.

While most transnational MSIs involve using voluntary standards to encourage socially and environmentally responsible private sector behavior, a handful of these initiatives – the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST), the Open Government Partnership (OGP), the Global Initiative on Fiscal Transparency (GIFT) and the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) – focus on information disclosure and participation in the public sector. Unlike private sector MSIs, which attempt to supplement weak government capacity to enforce basic social and environmental standards through partnerships between businesses and civil society, public sector MSIs ultimately seek to bolster public governance. But how exactly are these MSIs supposed to work? And how much has actually been achieved?\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify and consolidate the current state of the evidence for public governance-oriented MSI effectiveness and impact. Researchers collected over 300 documents and interviewed more than two-dozen MSI stakeholders about their experiences with five public governance oriented multi-stakeholder initiatives.\n\nThis report provides a ‘snapshot’ of the evidence related to these five MSIs, and suggests that the process of leveraging transparency and participation through these initiatives for broader accountability gains remains uncertain. The report highlights the ongoing process of defining MSI success and impact, and how these initiatives intersect with other accountability actors and processes in complex ways. The study closes with key recommendations for MSI stakeholders."},{"id":"a4a042cf4fd6bfb47701cbc8a1653ada","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Open Data, Privacy, and Fair Information Principles: Towards a Balancing Framework","organization":false,"authors":["Frederik J.

However, releasing government data that contain personal information may threaten privacy and related rights and interests. In this paper we ask how these privacy interests can be respected, without unduly hampering benefits from disclosing public sector information. We propose a balancing framework to help public authorities address this question in different contexts. The framework takes into account different levels of privacy risks for different types of data. It also separates decisions about access and re-use, and highlights a range of different disclosure routes. A circumstance catalogue lists factors that might be considered when assessing whether, under which conditions, and how a dataset can be released. While open data remains an important route for the publication of government information, we conclude that it is not the only route, and there must be clear and robust public interest arguments in order to justify the disclosure of personal information as open data."},{"id":"1ff8a7b5dc7a7d1f0ed65aaa29c04b1e","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Big Data as Governmentality – Digital Traces, Algorithms, and the Reconfiguration of Data in International Development","organization":false,"authors":["Mikkel Flyverbom","Andreas Rasche"],"paper_date":"12/2/15","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2698026","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Big Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":"development","region":false,"type":"white-paper","github":"","abstract":"This paper conceptualizes how large-scale data and algorithms condition and reshape knowledge production when addressing international development challenges. The concept of governmentality and four dimensions of an analytics of government are proposed as a theoretical framework to examine how big data is constituted as an aspiration to improve the data and knowledge underpinning development efforts. Based on this framework, we argue that big data’s impact on how relevant problems are governed is enabled by (1) new techniques of visualizing development issues, (2) linking aspects of international development agendas to algorithms that synthesize large-scale data, (3) novel ways of rationalizing knowledge claims that underlie development efforts, and (4) shifts in professional and organizational identities of those concerned with producing and processing data for development. Our discussion shows that big data problematizes selected aspects of traditional ways to collect and analyze data for development (e.g. via household surveys). We also demonstrate that using big data analyses to address development challenges raises a number of questions that can deteriorate its impact."},{"id":"f7e6c85504ce6e82442c770f7c8606f0","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Crowd Sourced Legislation and Politics: The Legitimacy of Constitutional Deliberation in Romania","organization":false,"authors":["Sergiu Gherghina","Sergiu Miscoiu"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2691938","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Crowdlaw"],"objective":["Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Case Analysis"]},"sector":"law","region":false,"type":"journal-article","github":"","abstract":"Constitutional reform is a tedious process that requires long periods of time, a relatively broad consensus among the political actors, and often needs popular approval.

It includes 22 studies that used self-reported measures of social media use and participation, with a total of 116 relationships/effects. The results suggest that social media use generally has a positive relationship with engagement and its three sub-categories, that is, social capital, civic engagement, and political participation. More specifically, we find small-to-medium size positive relationships between expressive, informational, and relational uses of social media and the above indicators of citizen engagement. For identity- and entertainment-oriented uses of social media, our analyses find little evidence supporting their relationship with citizen engagement."},{"id":"82161242827b703e6acf9c726942a1e4","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"OpenFDA: an innovative platform providing access to a wealth of FDA's publicly available data","organization":false,"authors":["Taha A.

There have been more than 20 million API calls (more than half from outside the United States), 6000 registered users, 20,000 connected Internet Protocol addresses, and dozens of new software (mobile or web) apps developed. A case study dem- onstrates a use of openFDA data to understand an apparent association of a drug with an adverse event.\n\nConclusion: With easier and faster access to these datasets, consumers worldwide can learn more about FDA-regulated products."},{"id":"38af86134b65d0f10fe33d30dd76442e","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Crowdsourced Off-Road Traffic Law Experiment in Finland: Report about idea crowdsourcing and evaluation","organization":false,"authors":["Tanja Aitamurto","Hélène Landemore","David Lee","Ashish Goel"],"paper_date":"1/2014","url":"http://pacscenter.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Goel-Landemore-Crowdsourcing-in-democracy-Crowdsourced-Law-Reform-in-Finland.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Crowdlaw"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Surveys","Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":"transportation","region":"europe","type":"research-report","github":"","abstract":""},{"id":"96da2f590cd7246bbde0051047b0d6f7","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"","title":"Crowdsourcing for Participatory Democracies: Efficient Elicitation of Social Choice Functions","organization":false,"authors":["David Lee","Ashish Goel","Tanja Aitamurto","Hélène Landemore"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://pacscenter.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Goel-Landemore-Crowdsourcing-for-democracy-2014.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Crowdlaw"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis","Conceptual Framework","Case Analysis"]},"sector":"transportation","region":"europe","type":"white-paper","github":"","abstract":""}]
